/*
What:       Bounded worker pool N workers pulling jobs from a channel, graceful shutdown
Level:      Beginner
Analogy:    A restaurant kitchen: N cooks take orders from a ticket queue. No cook is idle, no overflow.
C++ Angle:  Like a thread pool with a bounded queue, but trivial to implement with channels.
Interview:  "How do you limit concurrency in Go?" → Worker pool with buffered job channel.
